    <p>We are students with a vision, but we feel confused about our next steps and seek guidance to develop ourselves. We want someone to help us navigate our future and to track our activities and skills as part of<br>a portfolio. In response, we created this website to support other students like us who are also looking for<br>guidance for their growth. By connecting globally, we can improve ourselves together.As young people, we are the future of our world, and we aspire to be catalysts for change and empowerment. Therefore, we decided to name our initiative Junior (Jr) Catalyst.</p>
